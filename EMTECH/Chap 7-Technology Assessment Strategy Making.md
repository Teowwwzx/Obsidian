Focuses on how firm bridge the gap between a **cool new tech** and **winning business strategy.** Since emerging tech often unpredictable, can't just use a rigid 僵化, mechanical plan; you need a process that balances logic with creativity.

## The 4 Step Assessment Process
如果你是老板，你肯定不想因为看到别人在做 AI 就盲目跟风投几百万，结果发现这技术跟你的业务半毛钱关系没有（这就是 **Scoping** 的作用）。或者投了之后才发现，原来你的竞争对手早就在这块申请了专利把你堵死了（这就是没做好 **Searching**）。



A systematic way a firm looks at tech:
- **Scoping:** 
	- Strategy Intent 战略意图
	- Firm Capabilities 企业能力
- **Searching:** 
	- Knowledge Networks
		- Strong Signal
			- Patent & literature citations
			- Competitor's action
		- Weak Signal
			- Confirmation within the knowledge networks.
			- Competitive intelligence.
- **Evaluating:**
	- **Risk Profiling**
		- **Market Risk:** How big is the market? What customer need? How competitors fight back?
		- **Tech Risk:** Is this tech able to produce? Able to standardize? Can batch produce?
		- **Organizational Risk/implications 影响:** Is our staff capable to handle? Sufficient money to burn? Is company capable to catch up the trend?
		- **Potential financial rewards**
- **Committing:**
	- Strategic Commitment / 战略承诺
		- Risk and Reward of the relationship.

## 2. Strategy as an Art
> Strategy is an Art, not a Science.



This argues the strategy is like a **theory of success that hasn't been tested yet.** Because the future is uncertain, have to use **Disciplined Imagination** the **[[Twin Pillars of Strategy]].**

| Pillar      | What it is                                            | Goal                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discipline  | Consistent rules and rational analysis                | To avoid **avoidable errors** and stay grounded in reality.                   |
| Imagination | Creative **out-of-the-box** thinking and foresight 远见 | To generate diverse, distinct options and **think backward from the future.** |
