Focuses on how firm bridge the gap between a **cool new tech** and **winning business strategy.** Since emerging tech often unpredictable, can't just use a rigid 僵化, mechanical plan; you need a process that balances logic with creativity.

## The 4 Step Assessment Process
如果你是老板，你肯定不想因为看到别人在做 AI 就盲目跟风投几百万，结果发现这技术跟你的业务半毛钱关系没有（这就是 **Scoping** 的作用）。或者投了之后才发现，原来你的竞争对手早就在这块申请了专利把你堵死了（这就是没做好 **Searching**）。

- **Scoping (设定标准):** 你得先知道自己想找什么样的对象吧？（**Strategic Intent/战略意图**）。而且你得衡量一下自己的条件，别癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉（**Firm Capabilities/企业能力**）。
    
- **Searching (观察信号):** 开始到处看。有没有人介绍？（**Knowledge Networks/知识网络**）。对方有没有很多人追？（**Strong Signals/强信号**，比如专利、对手动作）。
    
- **Evaluating (深入评估):** 约出来见个面。性格合不合？（**Organizational Implications/组织影响**）。会不会有家暴风险？（**Risk Profiling/风险评估**）。在一起后能不能赚大钱？（**Financial Rewards/财务回报**）。
    
- **Committing (确认关系):** 最后决定：要不要结婚？（**Strategic Commitment/战略承诺**）。这取决于你有多喜欢（**Reward**）和你敢不敢承担离婚的风险（**Risk**）。

A systematic way a firm looks at tech:
- **Scoping:** Establishing clear limits based on **strategic intent (where you're going)** and **firm capabilities (what you're good at).**
- **Searching:** 
	- **Sensing Technological Emergence:** how tech manager detect a potentially transformative discovery to recognize some momentum beginning to form around a given tech.
	- **Strong signals:**
		- Patent & literature citations
		- Competitor's action.
	- **Weak signals:** More subtle indicators that discovery has commercial potential.
		- Confirmation within the knowledge networks.
		- Competitive intelligence.
	- **Knowledge & Information Capture:** As picture become more complex, company needs a system for keep track all the info & progress
- **Evaluating:**
	- **Risk Profiling**
		- **Market Risk:** How big is the market? What customer need? How competitors fight back?
		- **Tech Risk:** Is this tech able to produce? Able to standardize? Can batch produce?
		- Organizational Risk/implications 影响: Is our staff capable to handle? Sufficient money to burn? Is company capable to catch up the trend?
		- Potential financial rewards
- **Committing:**
	- Competitive imperative to take action
	- Risk reward relationship of the tech & its market
	- Signals of tech emergence of the new tech.

## 2. Strategy as an Art
This argues the strategy is like a **theory of success that hasn't been tested yet.** Because the future is uncertain, have to use **Disciplined Imagination** the **[[Twin Pillars of Strategy]].**

| Pillar      | What it is                                            | Goal                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discipline  | Consistent rules and rational analysis                | To avoid **avoidable errors** and stay grounded in reality.                   |
| Imagination | Creative **out-of-the-box** thinking and foresight 远见 | To generate diverse, distinct options and **think backward from the future.** |
