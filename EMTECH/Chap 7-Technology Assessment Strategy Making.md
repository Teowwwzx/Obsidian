Focuses on how firm bridge the gap between a **cool new tech** and **winning business strategy.** Since emerging tech often unpredictable, can't just use a rigid 僵化, mechanical plan; you need a process that balances logic with creativity.

## The 4 Step Assessment Process
如果你是老板，你肯定不想因为看到别人在做 AI 就盲目跟风投几百万，结果发现这技术跟你的业务半毛钱关系没有（这就是 **Scoping** 的作用）。或者投了之后才发现，原来你的竞争对手早就在这块申请了专利把你堵死了（这就是没做好 **Searching**）。



A systematic way a firm looks at tech:
- **Scoping:** 
	- Strategy Intent 战略意图
	- Firm Capabilities 企业能力
- **Searching:** 
	- Knowledge Networks
		- Strong Signal
			- Patent & literature citations
			- Competitor's action
		- Weak Signal
			- Confirmation within the knowledge networks.
			- Competitive intelligence.
- **Evaluating:**
	- **Risk Profiling**
		- **Market Risk:** How big is the market? What customer need? How competitors fight back?
		- **Tech Risk:** Is this tech able to produce? Able to standardize? Can batch produce?
		- **Organizational Risk/implications 影响:** Is our staff capable to handle? Sufficient money to burn? Is company capable to catch up the trend?
		- **Potential financial rewards**
- **Committing:**
	- Strategic Commitment / 战略承诺
		- Risk and Reward of the relationship.

## 2. Strategy as an Art
> Strategy is an Art, not a Science.

Due to future is uncertain, have to use **Disciplined Imagination** the **[[Twin Pillars of Strategy]].**

| Pillar      | What it is                                            | Goal                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discipline  | Consistent rules and rational analysis                | To avoid **avoidable errors** and stay grounded in reality.                   |
| Imagination | Creative **out-of-the-box** thinking and foresight 远见 | To generate diverse, distinct options and **think backward from the future.** |

### Discipline
| Benefits                                                                                                                     | Limitations                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Great consensus 达成共识** among top manager with supported data analysis                                                      | **Analysis rather than synthesis 只有拆解，没有整合** which analysis the details but not able to convert to a new synthesis 新愿景            |
| **More judicious 决策更审慎** with those analytical data                                                                          | **Selections at the generation 只选不造** within the data but it won't come up with new selection.                                    |
| **Identify avoidable error 纠正低级错误** to find previous mistake and error for improvement                                       | **Extrapolation from the past 迷信过去** is dangerous in emerging technology due to past data might outdated and not accurate already |
| **Exhaustive/inclusive process 全面整合** make sure the decision making is comprehensive without missing our any important info. | **Overconfidence in analysis 过度自信** that model is correct will lead the exactly same result but neglect 忽略 the reality incident.  |

### Imagination
| Benefits                                                                                        | Limitations                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adaptive thinking 适应性思维** which think out of the box                                          | **Chaos 混乱** with different ideas which miss focus                                                                                                                     |
| **Hierarchy of imagination 想象力等级制** which imagination will crash the experiences in front of it | **Losing touch with reality 脱离现实** which imagination might be good but in reality either can't implement or no one buying it                                           |
| **Future oriented 面向未来** which imagine the future of company and work backward                  | **Undervaluing the past 轻视过去** might loss the past success due to the traditional approach and **slowing the process** 拖慢进度 without implement those brainstorming idea |

### Disciplined Imagination
- Leverage imagination to produce different approach, and use discipline to assess the approach is it feasible.
- Build a period of idea generation using imagination and periods of disciplined idea evaluation

## As a summary, these are the areas covered:

1. Explaining the Technology Assessment Process.
	- **Scoping** to find out **==Strategic Intent where company want to go== and ==Firm Capabilities where company at currently==**
	- **Searching** to find out **==Strong Signals like patent & competitor's action==** and **==Weak Signals like confirmation within knowledge networks or competitive intelligence==**
	- Evaluating the **==tech using Ranking and Risk Profiling depend on the company reserve fund==**
	- **Committing** to the **==Reward and Risk with the situatable approach based on the time constraint/competitive imperative and return and risk==**

2. Explaining Risk Profiling.
	1. Market Risk
		- ==**Market momentum, customer demand, and competitor's action**==
	2. Technology Risk
		- **==Technology feasibility, able to standardize, and capabilities of implementation==**
	3. Organization Risk
		- ==**Capabilities of company and employees, cost, and fund burn rate**==

3. Explain Strategy making in uncertain environments
	- In uncertain environments where emerging technologies are rapidly evolving, traditional mechanical planning is no longer effective. Strategy must be viewed as a **==theory of success that has not yet been tested==**, requiring managers to adjust and create new strategies continually. To navigate this, firms must **==balance the two strategies of discipline and imagination.==** While discipline allows top managers to make **==rational decisions based on analytical data==**, it carries the ==**risk of extrapolation from the past**==, which may not apply to new technologies. Conversely, imagination creates huge potential for a company’s future by **==thinking out-of-the-box==**, though it can lead to **==chaos==** or **==slow down progress==** if not properly managed.

4. Discuss the art of strategy making
	- Strategy is considered an art because no guarantee can success, though it can certainly **==improve the odds 概率.==** The art lies in choosing one among many competing strategies for an actual test, as a firm cannot implement every possible option. Discipline ensures the company grows smoothly by applying **==consistent rules to evaluate alternatives==** and **==identifying avoidable errors==**. However, imagination is equally vital to enhance the **==attraction of a technology and sense==** needs before others do. Without this imaginative side, a firm might ==**solve a pain that doesn't exist**== or **==fail to capture the next big trend==** due to a **==conservative mind-set==** or ==**over confidence on past successes.**==

5. Explain the twin pillars of Strategy
	- The twin pillars of strategy are Discipline and Imagination. Discipline is the consistent application of rules to select alternatives that maximize value, helping managers be more judicious and achieve greater consensus. Imagination involves a deliberate effort to generate diverse, distinct options through synthesis, vision, and creativity. The most successful approach is "Disciplined Imagination," which capitalizes on the strengths of both pillars while avoiding their weaknesses. In this process, imagination is used to generate creative options and "think backward" from a desired future, while discipline grounds the process in reality by evaluating and implementing those options consistently.
