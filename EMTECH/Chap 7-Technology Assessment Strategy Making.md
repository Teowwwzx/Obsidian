## The 4 Step Assessment Process
A systematic way a firm looks at tech:

- **Searching:** 
	- **Sensing Technological Emergence:** how tech manager detect a potentially transformative discovery to recognize some momentum beginning to form around a given tech.
	- **Strong signals:** like patent & literature citations and competitor's action.
	- Weak signals: More subtle indicators that discovery has commercial potential.
		- 
	- Knowledge & Information Capture: As picture become more complex, company needs a system for keep track all the info & progress
- **Evaluating:** Ranking options using financial criteria and **Risk Profiling** to manage market, technology, and organizational risks.

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discipline  | Consistent rules and rational analysis                | To avoid **avoidable errors** and stay grounded in reality.                   |
| Imagination | Creative **out-of-the-box** thinking and foresight 远见 | To generate diverse, distinct options and **think backward from the future.** |
