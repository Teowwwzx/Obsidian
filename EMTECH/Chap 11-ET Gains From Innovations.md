## 2. The Four Mechanisms of Appropriability

| Mechanism            | Description                                                  | Example                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Patent & Legal       | Legal protection for machines or compositions of matter      | Valid for 20 years but legal costs are high                         |
| Secrecy              | Keeping the **how to** hidden from others                    | Easier for processes than for products                              |
| Complementary Assets | Resources like distribution, sales force, or service support | IBM used their sales/service strength to dominate, not just patents |
| Lead Time            | Being the fastest to develop and market the app              | Allow to build reputation before competitors appear                 |
