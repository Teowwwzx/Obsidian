## 1. The Three Hurdles 障碍 of Innovation
- **==Technology must be successful==:** the wonder widget must work.
- ==**Must create value==:** something buyers are willing to pay more than the cost of production.
- **==Appropriating Gains==:** must able to capture those rewards sometime innovator doesn't benefit from it.

## 2. The Four Mechanisms of Appropriability

| Mechanism                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      | Example                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ==Patent & Legal==              | ==Legal protection for machines or compositions/creations 作品== of matter<br><br>Effective in pharmaceuticals industry and moderate in computers and semi-conductors                              | Valid for 20 years but ==legal costs are high==                     |
| ==Secrecy==                     | Keeping the ==**how to** hidden from others==<br><br>Minimal risk when secret is too complex to transfer easily<br><br>Impact/hampered 受阻 future productivity of company R&D by too much secrecy | Easier for processes than for products                              |
| ==Complementary <br>互补 Assets== | Resources like distribution, service capability, or ==customer/supplier relationship==<br><br>New product ==lack of patentable==, required ==specialized facilities & manufacture==              | IBM used their sales/service strength to dominate, not just patents |
| ==Lead Time==                   | Being the ==fastest to develop and market the app==                                                                                                                                              | Allow to ==build reputation before competitors/rivar appear==       |


## 3. The **Intellectual Property** Trap
One of the biggest mistakes managers make is ==putting too much emphasis 强调 on patents.==
- **==Perceptual Distortion 直觉失真==:** Manager wrongly think a ==project isn't worth doing== just because they ==can't get a patent.==
- **==Inventing Around==:** Competitors can often ==**legally invent around**== a patent by producing a different version that doesn't infringe 侵犯 on the original idea.

## The Dynamic Capability (Golden Goose)
- Long term survival doesn't depend on just one single invention.
- Depend on building a system or culture that can sustain innovation accomplishments/achievement 成就 year after year.

## The Danger of Scope (Golden Eggs)
A slide warns managers about two extremes when they are trying to decide which eggs (tech) to focus on:
- **Narrow Scope (太窄):** If focus only on one tiny niche, the risk of company's skills becoming obsolete (过时) if a new tech suddenly replaces that niche.
- **Broad Scope (太广):** If you try to do everything at once which running with danger of losing focus and flexibility. Spread too thin to be great at anything.

## The Big Question
Which goose will produce the golden egg is a reminder that managers must constantly evaluate which of their internal teams or projects is most likely to deliver the next breakthrough.

## Summary
==**Guard the Golden Goose** to survive long-term==, a firm must ==protect its ability to innovate (the Goose)==. Managers must ==balance their focus==: ==**Narrow scope** makes them the risk to being replaced== with new tech, while a ==**Broad scope** causes a loss of focus.== The goal is to sustain ==**dynamic capabilities**== to keep ==producing **golden eggs (successful innovation)**==
