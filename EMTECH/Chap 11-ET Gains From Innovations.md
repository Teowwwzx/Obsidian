## 1. The Three Hurdles 障碍 of Innovation
- **Technology must be successful:** the wonder widget must work.
- **Must create value:** something buyers are willing to pay more than the cost of production.
- **Appropriating Gains:** must able to capture those rewards sometime innovator doesn't benefit from it.

## 2. The Four Mechanisms of Appropriability

| Mechanism            | Description                                                  | Example                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Patent & Legal       | Legal protection for machines or compositions of matter      | Valid for 20 years but legal costs are high                         |
| Secrecy              | Keeping the **how to** hidden from others                    | Easier for processes than for products                              |
| Complementary Assets | Resources like distribution, sales force, or service support | IBM used their sales/service strength to dominate, not just patents |
| Lead Time            | Being the fastest to develop and market the app              | Allow to build reputation before competitors appear                 |

## 3. The **Intellectual Property** Trap
One of the biggest mistakes managers make is putting too much emphasis 强调 on patents.
- **Perceptual Distortion:** Manager wrongly think a project isn't worth doing just because they can't get a patent.
- **Inventing Around:** Competitors can often **legally invent around** a patent by producing a different version that doesn't infringe on the original idea.

## The Dynamic Capability (Golden Goose)
- Long term survival doesn't depend on just one single invention.
- Depend on building a system or culture that can sustain innovation accomplishments/achievement 成就 year after year.

## The Danger of Scope (Golden Eggs)
A slide warns managers about two extremes when they are trying to decide which eggs (tech) to focus on:
- **Narrow Scope (太窄):** If focus only on one tiny niche, the risk of company's skills becoming obsolete (过时) if a new tech suddenly replaces that niche.
- **Broad Scope (太广):** If you try to do everything at once which running with danger of losing focus and flexibility. Spread too thin to be great at anything.

## The Big Question
Which goose will produce the golden egg
