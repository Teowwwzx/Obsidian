	- Paint the big picture
		- Issues: potential market could be **big enough** to support development activities.
	- Use multiple methods
		- All market estimation methods are flawed 有缺陷的 or limited in some important respect
	- Focus on need not products
		- Prospective 预期 customers can't envision 设想 radically new products based on discontinuous innovations.

# ==Scenario Planning==
Address three challenges:
1. **Uncertainty:** Distinguish any form of risks that can be quantified using objective probabilities.
2. **Complexity:** From social to technological to economics - explore how they combine, intermingle 交织 and dynamically influence.
3. **Paradigm Shift:** Scenarios aim to challenge the prevailing mind set.


## Constructing Scenarios
- Issues want to understand
- Identify major stake holders and actors
- Identify and study the main forces that are shaping the future (==STEEP==)
	- **==Social (社会)**==
	- ==**Technological (技术)**==
	- ==**Economic (经济)**==
	- ==**Environmental (环境)**==
	- ==**Political (政治)==**
- Identify trends or predetermined elements
- Identify the key uncertainties from the list of main forces


## ==Surrogate Crisis== 模拟危机
The future is uncertain and experts are often wrong, firms use **Scenario Planning.**
- Instead drawing single future, it create a vision of many possible futures
- Scenario planning acts as a **simulated crisis**. It's better to imagine a crisis and prepare for it now than to wait for a real one when its too late to survive
- It help overcome ==**strategic myopia (战略近视)== (narrow-mindedness)** and **frame blindness.**
