# 1. The 4 Common Traps for Established Firms
大公司就像一头大象，虽然强壮，但转身太慢
- **==Delayed Participation== (慢半拍):**
	- High uncertainty (rational to **watch and wait**).
	- Suitable for narrow applications not yet required by existing customer.
	- Earlier of ET often immature and not suitable for existing customer.
- ==**Sticking with the Familiar== (只玩会玩的):** 以前成功过的经验变成了现在的枷锁
	- Sticking with the known is even more appealing 有吸引力的 because of the past success reinforces old ways of problem-solving.
	- Lack of in-house capability to judge new tech.
	- A proprietary mindset
- ==**Reluctance 抗拒 to Fully Commit== (不敢下重注):** 
	- ==**Cannibalizing 自相残杀** existing profitable products.==
	- Hard to justify investments in ET using traditional ROI criteria.
	- Focused on meeting the needs of their current customers rather than looking to serve new markets
	- Successful organizations are not naturally ambidextrous/flexible/highly skilled
- **==Lack of Persistence (没耐心)==:** 只要一两个季度没见到回头钱，老板就想撤资 。
	- Facing pressure for quarterly results, firms may lose patience.
	- Missed forecasts during gestation of ET.

# 2. The 4 Strategic Solutions
- **Widening Peripheral Vision:** Looking beyond direct competitors to sense emerging trends. It requires focusing on customer needs rather than just current products.
	- Paint the big picture
		- Issues: potential market could be **big enough** to support development activities.
	- Use multiple methods
		- All market estimation methods are flawed 有缺陷的 or limited in some important respect
	- Focus on need not products
		- Prospective 预期 customers can't envision 设想 radically new products based on discontinuous innovations.
- Creating a learning culture: 
	- Encourage openness to diverse viewpoints
	- Reward **well-intentioned** failure.
	- Organization forget outdated approaches.
- Staying flexible in strategic ways
	- Higher flexibility lowers the cost of committing than a reverse direction.
	- Balance within the options perspective, study your rivals intently and change direction boldly.
- Providing organizational autonomy
	- Taking ET business into separate unit or spin-off. This separate unit is less held back by the big-firm mindset and risk avoidance of the company

# ==Scenario Planning==
Address three challenges:
1. **Uncertainty:** Distinguish any form of risks that can be quantified using objective probabilities.
2. **Complexity:** From social to technological to economics - explore how they combine, intermingle 交织 and dynamically influence.
3. **Paradigm Shift:** Scenarios aim to challenge the prevailing mind set.


## Constructing Scenarios
- Identify ==issues want to understand==
- Identify major stake holders and actors
- Identify and study the main forces that are shaping the future (==STEEP==)
	- **==Social (社会)**==
	- ==**Technological (技术)**==
	- ==**Economic (经济)**==
	- ==**Environmental (环境)**==
	- ==**Political (政治)==**
- Identify trends or predetermined elements
- Identify the key uncertainties from the list of main forces


## ==Surrogate Crisis== 模拟危机
The future is uncertain and experts are often wrong, firms use **Scenario Planning.**
- Instead drawing single future, it create a vision of many possible futures
- Scenario planning acts as a **simulated crisis**. It's better to imagine a crisis and prepare for it now than to wait for a real one when its too late to survive
- It help overcome ==**strategic myopia (战略近视)== (narrow-mindedness)** and **frame blindness.**

**Chapter 12: Avoiding Pitfalls of ET**

_Students can conduct online/offline research (without reference list/citations) in-order to assist in answering the following questions._

**Question 1**

In today’s era, there are more and more people utilizing their television sets to consume entertainment and media related content from online streaming services such as Hulu, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and many more. In accordance with a research conducted, it can be seen that consumers of these streaming services are spending at least 19% of their time accessing and viewing streaming content.

Among the popular streaming services that are currently available, Netflix is one of the streaming services that is currently dominating compared to others. The subscription-based streaming service provider holds 31% of the all the content in which U.S consumers are streaming on their Television. The second in the list with 21% is the free streaming platform, YouTube. Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and other streaming service provides rounds up the top four with a combination of 28% [1].

Grab Food, Food Panda and other similar applications that is available has already disrupted the traditional food delivery business, likewise, instant messaging applications like WhatsApp and WeChat has already disrupts the telecommunication industry. The above discussion reflecting towards “streaming services” has given a potential negative signal and impact towards the Television (TV) channels service providers / broadcasting services.

**_In-regards to the above:_**

a. Critically analyse the streaming service firms with the established Television (TV) broadcasting companies on the common traps or pitfalls in trying to get familiar with Emerging Technologies (ET).

Established TV broadcasting companies often struggle to compete with streaming services because they fall into four common traps:
- **==Delayed Participation==:** While streaming services move fast, traditional TV firms often ==watch and wait== due to the ==high uncertainty of digital infrastructure==. They often ==dismiss== the early ==streaming tech is immature== or ==not suitable== for their ==existing traditional audience==.
- **==Sticking with the Familiar==:** TV broadcasters often ==rely on past successes== in cable or satellite models to guide their decision-making. This leads them to search for solutions only within their current technical skills with a ==propriety mind-set== that prevents them for seeing the value of open-platform streaming.
- **==Reluctance/unwillingness 抗拒 to Fully Commit==:** A major hurdle is the fear of ==cannibalizing/take part of 吞噬 their own profitable cable ad revenue==. Because streaming investments are ==difficult to calculate the ROI==, broadcasters often make ==timid/afraid choice rather than bold moves==. They fail to be ==ambidextrous 怀二心的== to have the ability to maintain the old business while exploring new.
- **==Lack of Persistence 坚持==:** Faced the ==pressure of quarterly financial results==, TV ==incumbents 现任者/holder== often ==lose patience with the gestation period== of new digital platform. If a new streaming app ==doesn't profit immediately==, they may withdraw too early just like the Knight-Ridder did with early electronic news.

b. Examine the potential solutions for Television (TV) broadcasting companies to overcome the above-mentioned traps or pitfalls as well as ensuring they remain competitive.

To remain competitive and overcome these pitfalls, TV broadcasting firms should implement the following four solutions:
- ==**Widening Peripheral 周围的 Vision==:** Broadcasters must look ==beyond their TV rivals== and focus on the ==needs of audience== such as on-demand and mobile-first access ==rather than the product== like traditional scheduled programming. They should ==paint the big picture== of the market to ensure the potential digital audience is large enough to support the shift.
- **==Creating a Learning Culture==:** The organization must move beyond individual knowledge to ==**collective learning==.** This requires ==encouraging openness== to ==share different viewpoints== and ==rewarding **well-intentioned** failure== when experimenting with new approach. They must be willing to ==forgot the outdated== cable-era approaches.
- **==Staying Flexible in Strategic Ways==:** Broadcasters should keep an ==options perspective== which allowing them to change direction boldly and quickly if a specific technology like VR or interactive TV doesn't take off. This flexibility ==lowers the cost of both== making a ==commitment and reversing== it if necessary.
- **==Providing Organizational Autonomy==:** To ==escape the big firm mindset==, the streaming venture should be placed in a ==separate unit==. This allow the ==new unit to operate with its own== management team and risk tolerance, ==free from== the ==parent company's ROI constraints==.
