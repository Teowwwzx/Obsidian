2. **Complexity:** From social to technological to economics - explore how they combine, intermingle 交织 and dynamically influence.
3. **Paradigm Shift:** Scenarios aim to challenge the prevailing mind set.

### Trap to Avoid
- Failing to get top management support early on
- Lack of diverse inputs
- Failure to stimulate new strategic options
- Not tracking the scenarios progress & performance

### A good Tool
- Visualize the impact of technological discontinuities on the organizations existing models

### Surrogate Crisis
The future is uncertain and experts are often wrong, firms use **Scenario Planning.**
- Instead drawing single future, it create a vision of many possible futures
