# 1. The 4 Common Traps for Established Firms
大公司就像一头大象，虽然强壮，但转身太慢
- **==Delayed Participation== (慢半拍):**
	- High uncertainty (rational to **watch and wait**).
	- Suitable for narrow applications not yet required by existing customer.
	- Earlier of ET often immature and not suitable for existing customer.
- ==**Sticking with the Familiar== (只玩会玩的):** 以前成功过的经验变成了现在的枷锁
	- Sticking with the known is even more appealing 有吸引力的 because of the past success reinforces old ways of problem-solving.
	- Lack of in-house capability to judge new tech.
	- A proprietary mindset
- ==**Reluctance 抗拒 to Fully Commit== (不敢下重注):** 
	- ==**Cannibalizing 自相残杀** existing profitable products.==
	- Hard to justify investments in ET using traditional ROI criteria.

# 2. The 4 Strategic Solutions
- **Widening Peripheral Vision:** Looking beyond direct competitors to sense emerging trends. It requires focusing on customer needs rather than just current products.
	- Paint the big picture
		- Issues: potential market could be **big enough** to support development activities.
	- Use multiple methods
		- All market estimation methods are flawed 有缺陷的 or limited in some important respect
	- Focus on need not products
		- Prospective 预期 customers can't envision 设想 radically new products based on discontinuous innovations.
- Creating a learning culture: 
	- Encourage openness to diverse viewpoints
	- Reward **well-intentioned** failure.
	- Organization forget outdated approaches.
- Staying flexible in strategic ways
	- Higher flexibility lowers the cost of committing than a reverse direction.
	- Balance within the options perspective, study your rivals intently and change direction boldly.
- Providing organizational autonomy
	- Taking ET business into separate unit or spin-off. This separate unit is less held back by the big-firm mindset and risk avoidance of the company

# Scenario Planning
Address three challenges:
1. **Uncertainty:** Distinguish any form of risks that can be quantified using objective probabilities.
2. **Complexity:** From social to technological to economics - explore how they combine, intermingle 交织 and dynamically influence.
3. **Paradigm Shift:** Scenarios aim to challenge the prevailing mind set.


## Constructing Scenarios
- Issues want to understand
- Identify major stake holders and actors
- Identify and study the main forces that are shaping the future (STEEP)
- Identify trends or predetermined elements
- Identify the key uncertainties from the list of main forces

### Trap to Avoid
- Failing to get top management support early on
- Lack of diverse inputs
- Failure to stimulate new strategic options
- Not tracking the scenarios progress & performance

### A good Tool
- Visualize the impact of technological discontinuities on the organizations existing models

### Surrogate Crisis
The future is uncertain and experts are often wrong, firms use **Scenario Planning.**
- Instead drawing single future, it create a vision of many possible futures
- Scenario planning acts as a **simulated crisis**. It's better to imagine a crisis and prepare for it now than to wait for a real one when its too late to survive
- It help overcome **strategic myopia (narrow-mindedness)** and **frame blindness.**
