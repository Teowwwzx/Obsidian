- **What it is:** An open-source automation server.
    
- **Role:** It is the "engine" for **CI/CD**. When you push code, Jenkins automatically triggers a "Pipeline" to test, build, and deploy your app.
    
- **Modern alternative:** You are using **GitHub Actions**, which is the modern, cloud-native version of Jenkins.
