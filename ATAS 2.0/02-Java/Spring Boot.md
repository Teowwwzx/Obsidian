### 💡 How to tie this to your ATAS project?

In an interview, you can say:

> "While I built ATAS 2.0 using **FastAPI** for its high-performance asynchronous capabilities, I followed **Defensive Programming** principles to handle data validation. I also integrated a **CI/CD** pipeline (similar to **Jenkins**) using **GitHub Actions**, and used **Locust** for load testing, which is the Python equivalent of **JMeter**."
