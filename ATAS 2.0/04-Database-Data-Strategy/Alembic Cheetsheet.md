# 🐘 Alembic Migration Cheatsheet

  Alembic is a database migration tool for usage with SQLAlchemy. It helps you manage database schema changes (creating tables, adding columns) in a version-controlled way.

## 🚦 When to run migrations?

You **DO NOT** need to run migrations for every code change.

Run them **ONLY** when you modify `app/models/*.py` files:

- Creating a new model (Table)

- Adding/Removing a column

- Changing a column type (e.g., `String` -> `Integer`)

- Modifying constraints (Unique, Nullable, Foreign Keys)

## 🛠️ Common Commands

  
### 1. Check Status

See if your models match the database.

```bash

alembic check

```

- **Success:** No output or "No new upgrade operations detected."

- **Failure:** Shows list of detected differences (drift).

  
### 2. Create a Migration (Auto)

Generate a new migration script based on changes in your models.

```bash

alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe_your_change"

```

*Example: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add_avatar_to_users"`*


### 3. Apply Migrations (Upgrade)

Apply pending migrations to the database (make it up-to-date).

```bash

alembic upgrade head

```

  
### 4. Undo Last Migration (Downgrade)

Revert the last applied migration (be careful with data loss!).

```bash

alembic downgrade -1

```

  
### 5. View History

Show migration history.

```bash

alembic history

```

  
### 6. Show Current Version

Show the current revision of the database.

```bash

alembic current

```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting "Drift"

If `alembic check` fails but you didn't change models, it might be due to:

1.  **Type Mismatches:** (e.g., `pgvector` types sometimes confuse Alembic).

2.  **Manual DB Changes:** Someone changed the DB manually without a migration.

3.  **Import Issues:** The model file wasn't imported in `alembic/env.py`, so Alembic doesn't "see" it.

  
### Fix Drift (Sync)

If the DB is correct but Alembic is confused, you might need to adjust the migration file manually or use:

```bash

# If models are right, generate a migration to sync DB to models

alembic revision --autogenerate -m "sync_schema"

alembic upgrade head

```
