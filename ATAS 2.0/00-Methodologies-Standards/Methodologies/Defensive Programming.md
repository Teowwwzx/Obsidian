- **What it is:** A mindset where you write code under the assumption that "everything that can go wrong, will go wrong."
    
- **Example:** You don't just assume a user will enter a number for `age`; you check if it's null, if it's negative, or if it's a string _before_ processing it.
    
- **Goal:** Preventing the app from crashing when unexpected data enters the system.
