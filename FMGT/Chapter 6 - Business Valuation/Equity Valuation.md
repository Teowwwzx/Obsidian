## **Valuation of a preference share**
$$V_{p}=\frac{D}{K_{p}}$$
$V_{p}$ = Value of the preference share ($P$ stand for intrinsic value 内在价值)
$D$ = Annual dividend
$K_{p}$ = Required rate of return

---

## **Expected Rate of Return**
$$E(R)=(P_{1}*R_{1})+(P_{2}*R_{2})+\dots\dots$$
$R$ = The probability of the i-th return occurring
$R_{i}$ = The i-th possible return
$n$ = The total number of possible return

**QUESTION 1**
Calculate the intrinsic value of a preference share paying a $2.70 dividend per share considering you need a 12% required rate of return.

P = is the price (or insrinsic value) of the preference share,
D = is the annual dividend,
R = is the required rate of return.

$$22.5=\frac{2.7}{0.12}$$

**QUESTION 2**
The ==risk-free rate of return is 8%,== the ==expected rate of return== on the ==market portfolio is 15%,== and the stock of Xyrong Corporation has a ==beta coefficient of 1.2.== Xyrong pays out ==40%== of its earnings in ==dividends==, and the latest earnings announced were ==$4 per share==. Dividends were just paid and are expected to be paid annually. You expect that Xyrong will earn an ==ROE of 20%== per year on all reinvested earnings forever. Estimate the ==intrinsic value== of a share of Xyrong stock.

1. Required rate of return (CAPM) = **16.4%**
$$k_{i}=k_{RF}+(k_{M}-k_{RF})ß_{i}$$
	$k_{rf}$ = Risk Free Rate
	$k_{m}$ = Market Return
	$ß$ = Beta

$$16.4=0.08+(0.15-0.08)1.2$$
2. Growth Rate (g) = **12%**
$$G=ROE*pr$$
	$pr$ = retention rate 留存率, not payout ratio
$$0.2*(1-0.4)=0.2*(0.6)=12$$

3. Calculate the Expected Dividend for the First Period ($D_0$) = $1.6
$$D_{0}=EPS_{0}*DividendPayoutRatio$$
	$EPS_0$ = Latest Earning Per Share = $4
	Dividend Payout Ratio = 40%
$$4*0.4=1.6$$

4. Calculate the Expected Dividend for the Next Period ($D_1$) = **$1.792**
$$D_{1}=D_{0}*(1+g)$$
$$1.6*(1+0.12)=1.792$$

5. Calculate the Common Stock with Growing Dividends (Gordan Growth Model) = ==**40.73%**==
$$V_{cs}=\frac{D_{1}}{R_{s}-g}$$
	$D$ = Annual Dividend
	$R$ = Required Rate of Return
$$\frac{1.792}{0.164-0.12}=40.73$$

**QUESTION 3**
The dividend policy of Kala Inc. has been recently increased to ==pay 40%== of its ==earnings== to shareholders. With an ==after-tax income== of ==$3.6 million,== the company has just ==paid dividends of $3== per share to its shareholders. The company has a ==beta of 1.5== on the stock index. The average equity ==market return is 13%== and the government securities are yielding at ==3%.== Currently, ==5 million shares== are trading at ==$6 per share.== Based on its recent book, Kala Inc. has a ==total asset== of ==$60m== and total ==liabilities totaling $30m.==


i.	Calculate the growth rate of dividends.
$$g=(ROE*pr)$$
	$pr$ = Dividend Payout Ratio, not same as the Retention Ratio in growth rate formula

 1. Calc Fucking Shareholder's Equity
$$60000000-30000000=30000000$$
	 Shareholder's Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities


 2. Calc Fucking ROE = 12%
$$ROE=\frac{AfterTaxIncome}{Shareholder'sEquity}$$
	 
$$3600000/30000000=0.12$$

3. growth rate of dividends = 7.2%
$$12*(1-0.4)=12(0.6)=7.2$$

ii.	If the share is trading at $25 per share, would you invest in this company?
$$V_{cs}=\frac{D_{1}}{R_{s}-g}$$
	$D$=
	$R$=
	$g$=7.2%

1. Calc CAPM = 18%
$$0.03+(0.13-0.03)1.5=0.18$$

2. Calc $D_{1}$ (Expected Dividend for Next Period) = $3.216
$$3*(1+0.072)=3.216$$

3. Calc Intrinsic value
$$\frac{3.216}{0.18-0.072}=29.78$$


iii.	Assume that you proceed to buy the share at the quoted price of ==$25 per share,== and the share price eventually reaches the level you calculated in (ii.). Estimate your total returns after a year holding period.
 

Total Return = Dividend Yield + Capital Gains Yield

$\frac{D_{1}}{P_{b}}$ = 3.216 / 25 = 0.12864
$\frac{P_{1}-P_{0}}{P_{0}}$ = 29.78 - 25 / 25 = 0.1912

0.12864 + 0.1912 = 0.31984 = 31.98%










**QUESTION 4**

Dodge Inc. pays a dividend of $1 and is currently selling for $32.50. If investors require a 12% return on their investment from buying Dodge’s stock, what growth rate would Dodge’s Inc. have to provide the investors?

  $P_{0}=\frac{D_{1}}{R_{s}-g}$

$P_{0}$ = Current Price = 32.50
$D_0$ = 1
$R_s$ = 12%
$g$ = growth rate = 

32.50 = 1(1+g) / 0.12 - g

(32.50) (0.12 - g) = 1(1+g)
3.9-32.50g = 1+g
3.9-1=g+32.50g
2.9=33.5g
2.9/33.5=g
g=8.66%
