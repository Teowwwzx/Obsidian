## **Future Value (FV)**
The value of a current asset at a future date based on assumed rate of growth.
$$
FV=PV*(1+r)^2
$$
FV = Future Value
PV = Resent Value
r = Annual interest rate (decimal)
n = Number of periods (usually years)

---
## **Present Value (PV)** 
The current value of a future sum of money given a specified rate of return.
$$PV=\frac{FV}{(1+r)^2}$$

**Question 1**
Bob ==received $12,345== for his services as a financial consultant to the mayor’s office of his hometown of Springfield. Bob says that his consulting work was his civic duty and that he should not receive any compensation. So, he invested his paycheck into an account paying ==3.98% annual interest== and left the account in his will to the city of Springfield on the condition that the city could not collect any money from the account for 200 years. Compute ==how much money== the city ==will receive== from Bob’s generosity in 200 years.

> PV = 12345
> r = 3.98
> n = 200

$$30300773.41=12345*(1+0.0398)^{200}$$

**Question 2**
The Lexington Property Development Company has a ==$10,000 note receivable== from a customer ==due in 3 years.== Estimate ==how much== is the note ==worth today== if the interest rate is: 
a. 9% annual interest? 
$$7721.834801=\frac{10000}{(1+0.09)^{3}}$$
b. 12% compounded monthly? 
$$6989.24=\frac{10000}{\left( 1+\left( \frac{0.12}{12} \right) \right)^{36}}$$
c. 8% compounded quarterly?
$$7884.93=\frac{1000}{\left( 1+\left( \frac{0.08}{4} \right) \right)^{12}}$$


## **Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity**
$$PVOA=PMT*\left[ 1-\frac{(1+r)^{-n}}{r} \right]$$
PMT = The amount of each periodic payment

**Question 3**
Antonio Bieber is an actor and he just received three (3) acting offers for a ==five-year contract.== Offer A is a ==$10 million== offer for a ==$2 million payout a year==. Offer B is a $11 million offer of $1 million a year for four years and $7m in year 5. Offer C also worth $11 million with a $7 million payout will be paid in the first year and the remaining will be paid out evenly until year 5. 

Antonio Bieber learnt that the inflation rate will remain at 3% for the next five years. Hence, as a newly appointed personal financial advisor, you are asked to assist Antonio Bieber in choosing the best offer for the next five years of his acting career.

n=5

offer A: 9159414.37
$$9159414.374=2000000*\left[ 1-\frac{(1+0.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \right]$$

offer B: 9755359.9
$$9755359.9=970873.79+942595.91+915141.66+888487.05+6038261.49=\frac{1000000}{(1+0.03)^{1}}+\frac{1000000}{(1+0.03)^{2}}+\frac{1000000}{(1+0.03)^{3}}+\frac{1000000}{(1+0.03)^{4}}+\frac{7000000}{(1+0.03)^{5}}$$

offer C: 10404949.91
$$10404949.91=6796116.51+942595.91+915141.66+888487.05+862608.78=\frac{7000000}{(1+0.03)^1}+\frac{1000000}{(1+0.03)^2}+\frac{1000000}{(1+0.03)^3}+\frac{1000000}{(1+0.03)^4}+\frac{1000000}{(1+0.03)^5}$$
