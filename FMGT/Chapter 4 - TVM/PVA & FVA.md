## **Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity**
$$FVOA=PMT*\left[ \frac{(1+r)^{-n}-1}{r} \right]$$
PMT = The amount of each periodic payment

## **Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity**
$$PVOA=PMT*\left[ \frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r} \right]$$
PMT = The amount of each periodic payment

**Question 1**
Compute the present value of a 10-year annuity that pays $1,000 annually, given a 10% discount rate. 
$$6144.57=1000*\left[ \frac{1-(1+0.1)^{-10}}{0.1} \right]$$

## **Present Value of an Annuity Due**
$$PVAD=PMT*\left[ \frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r} \right]*(1+r)$$
PMT = The amount of each periodic payment

**Question 2**
Compute the present value of an annuity due of $1,000 per year for 10 years discounted at an annual rate of 15%.
$$5771.58=1000*\left[ 1-\frac{(1+0.15)^{-10}}{0.15} \right]*(1+0.15)$$

**Question 3**
Upon graduating from college 35 years ago, Dr. Nick was already planning his retirement. Since then, he has made deposits into a retirement fund every quarter for $300. Nick has just completed his final payment and is finally ready to retire. His retirement fund has earned 9% compounded quarterly. Estimate how much has Nick accumulated in his retirement account.
$$287138.02=300*\left[\frac{(1+0.0225)^{140}-1}{0.0225} \right]$$

**Question 4**
You believe in the power of compounding and decide to save $1 per day by avoiding purchasing a soda. You deposit the $1 at the end of each day in a bank account that pays 8% interest compounded daily. You will take a trip in 20 years with the money you have accumulated. Estimate how much money you will have in 20 years, assuming 365 days per year.
$$18099.82=1*\left[ \frac{(1+0.00022)^{7300}-1}{0.00022} \right]$$

**Question 5**
Your son will be attending an expensive university in 12 years. You deposit $5,000 per year for 12 years, at the beginning of today’s period. How much money will be in the college fund 12 years from now if the fund earns 8% per year?
FVAD
$$102476.48=5000*\left[ \frac{(1+0.08)^{12}-1}{0.08} \right]*(1+0.08)$$

## **Present Value of a Perpetuity**
$$PVP=\frac{PMT}{r}$$
PMT = The amount of each periodic payment

**Question 6**
What is the present value of a $500 perpetuity discounted back to the present at 8 percent?
$$6250=\frac{500}{0.08}$$
